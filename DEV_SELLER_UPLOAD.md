Developer testing: Seller service upload (dev-only)

Overview
--------
This document explains how the dev-only seller service flow works, how to test it locally, and where uploaded files and service records are stored.

Files and endpoints
-------------------
- Client new service page: `src/app/seller/services/new/page.tsx`
  - Drag-and-drop + file input, image previews, client validation, and upload progress.
  - Posts JSON payload (base64 images) to `/api/seller/services`.

- Dev seller services API: `src/app/api/seller/services/route.ts`
  - GET: returns services from `data/seller-services.json`.
  - POST: accepts JSON with base64 images, writes files to `data/uploads/` and pushes an item into `data/seller-services.json`.

- Static uploads serve: `src/app/api/static/uploads/route.ts`
  - Serve files from `data/uploads` by filename via `/api/static/uploads?name=<filename>`.

Where data is stored (dev)
--------------------------
- Uploaded image files: `data/uploads/` (binary files). Names are generated by the server.
- Services JSON (dev listing): `data/seller-services.json`.

How to test locally
-------------------
1. Start dev server from project root (PowerShell):

```powershell
npm run dev
```

2. Ensure you are logged in as a seller. Options:
   - Register a user with role "بائع" and then log in.
   - Or use the dev cookie override endpoint (if available) to set `dev_user_role=seller`.

3. Open the new service page in the browser:
   http://localhost:3000/seller/services/new

4. Fill the form:
   - Title, description, price (>= 10), delivery days.
   - Add 1–5 images via the file picker or drag-and-drop.

5. Click "نشر الخدمة". You should see an upload progress indicator during the POST. On success you'll be redirected to `/seller/services?created=1`.

6. Verify persistence:
   - Check `data/uploads/` for the new image files.
   - Check `data/seller-services.json` for the new service entry (usually at the top of the array).

Notes and limitations
---------------------
- This flow is intended for local development and testing only. The API writes files to the project filesystem and updates a JSON file.
- Uploads are sent as base64 within JSON. For production you'd replace this flow with signed S3 uploads or similar.
- Progress reporting is implemented in the client with `XMLHttpRequest` and reflects client-side upload progress for the JSON payload.

Next improvements (optional)
----------------------------
- Server-side validation and limits (reject oversized images).
- Replace base64-within-JSON with streaming upload or multipart/form-data.
- Add remove/replace for existing service images UI on edit page.
- Add server-side auth gating to ensure only real sellers can POST (not just client-side check).

If you want, I can add automated tests (unit/integration) for the dev API and a small checklist in the repo README.
